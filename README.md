Coastal flood risk analysis for Jakarta, Indonesia

URECA Project by Bernadette Chuah

July 2024

This risk analysis framework is done step by step. More detailed instructions are included in each Python code. 
1. Combine_hazard_tiles.py (merging 2 spatially different hazard tiles)
2. Assign_damage_to_flood_depths.py (assigning % damage values to corresponding flood depths in m)
3. Revised_dmg_curve_elevation.py (plotting damage-flood depth curve and adjusting it for policy of elevating building heights)
4. threshold_above_50.py (filtering pixels with significant damage; set a threshold)
5. part 5 of analysis (not a Python code, done in QGIS)
6. assign_bc_to_urban_extent.py (assigns present day building count)
7. assign_bc_2018_2030.py (assigns values to future urban extent rasters)
